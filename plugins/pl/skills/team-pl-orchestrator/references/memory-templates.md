# Memory Templates

Use these templates in the configured memory backend (see the adapter references).

## Note Format

Feature and decision notes start with YAML frontmatter (OKF-compatible: `type`, `title`, `status`, `date`, `owner`, `work`, plus `repo`/`status_note`/`tags` when relevant). Frontmatter is the single machine-read surface: Obsidian indexes it natively (property search, Bases/Dataview) and agents can read only the first lines of a file to know its state without parsing the body. Relational links (`Related decisions:`, `Related feature:`, etc.) stay in the body under the H1 so link validation and backlink insertion keep working. Do not duplicate frontmatter fields as plain body lines; legacy unmigrated notes with a plain `Status:` line are still accepted by `check` as a fallback only.

## Workspace Layout

Store new work under a 업무/project namespace (path shown for the Obsidian backend; the Notion adapter maps the same structure to databases):

```text
<vault-root>/
  INDEX.md
  work/
    <work-slug>/
      INDEX.md
      features/
        YYYY-MM-DD-feature-slug.md
      decisions/
        YYYY-MM-DD-decision-slug.md
      architecture/
        README.md
```

Selection rule:
- If the user names a 업무/project/product, slugify that name.
- Otherwise use the canonical repository name: the basename of `git remote get-url origin` with any `.git` suffix removed. With no remote, use the main repository directory name (resolve `git rev-parse --git-common-dir` to the repository root) — never the worktree or workspace directory name; launchers such as orca run sessions in renamed worktrees. Outside a git repository, treat the namespace as unclear.
- If neither is clear, use `inbox` only as a temporary namespace and record why.

Never put unrelated 업무 A and 업무 B in the same feature note or decision folder.

Use relative Markdown links between feature and decision notes. The feature note links to every durable decision, and each decision links back to its feature. Keep superseded notes; mark their status and successor instead of deleting history.
